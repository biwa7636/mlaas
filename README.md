This is a repositary where I stored some dummy examples of how to build a RESTful API around machine learning model. 

Each of the directory in this repo is named in a way like 
```service_{programming language}_{keywords like libraries}```

Things to do: 

1. python -> (pickle) -> python (flask) 
2. r -> (rda) -> r (plumber)
3. r -> (pmml) -> java (openscoring)
4. python/r (h2o) -> (pojo) -> java (springbok)
